Bring Your Own Device Endpoint Checklist

Many firms allow workers to use their own mobile devices to conduct work-related tasks. A poorly protected personal mobile device might expose an enterprise or employee to data loss or a privacy violation. Ensuring the security of an organizationâ€™s data when its use from personal devices brings new obstacles and hazards.

The goal of this checklist is to outline best practices for users within an organization to use their own devices safely and securely in an enterprise environment.

Checklist:
1.	Know Your Devices
  a.	Establish which devices you are ready to support. 
  b.	Know which devices meet security standards and let users know what they can and cannot use.
  c.	Find out which devices have native enterprise management tools and which ones use third-party tools.
2.	Establish Ground Rules
  a.	Make users aware that their personal data may be wiped if their data is compromised.
  b.	If users are using their own devices, make sure they understand the risk involved.
  c.	Make this clear before they start using the device for work.
3.	Lock-Down data
  a.	Make security measures, such as having a PIN or encryption, mandatory.
  b.	Complete periodic security audits to help verify the safety of company data and assess any potential risks.
  c.	Encrypt data when possible.
4.	Vet Apps
  a.	Not all apps meet security standards.
  b.	Determine which apps users will help users in their work, without compromising company data.
  c.	Set up an app lab and test them to see which ones meet business needs.
  d.	Find the correct apps, then recommend them to users.
5.	Training
  a.	If BYOD is in your security policies, train users in proper BYOD practice.
  b.	Develop a formal BYOD policy that understands privacy rights and access rights for both employees and employers.
